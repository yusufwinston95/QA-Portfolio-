# Ride‑Sharing Mobile UI Testing – iPhone (Lyft)

**Tester:** Yusuf Winston  
**Device:** iPhone (model/version to fill)  
**App:** Lyft (App Store) – exploratory UI and smoke testing (non-production account)  
**Scope:** App launch, permissions, navigation menu/profile, request flow (as far as possible without ride confirmation), cancellation, and error/empty-state messaging.

## How Evidence Was Collected
- Native iOS screenshots
- Notes taken during exploration
- No personal data stored; redact phone numbers if captured

## Deliverables

- [Bug/Observation Log](./bug-report-log.md)
- [Test Summary](./test-summary.md)
- Screenshots in `/screenshots`

> Tip: If login requires SMS verification, stop before verification and test guest-accessible flows and UI; document permission prompts and navigation elements.
