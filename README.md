# ✅ Yusuf Winston – Software QA Engineer

Hi! I’m Yusuf — a detail-oriented QA Engineer skilled in manual testing for web and mobile applications. I ensure excellent software quality by executing test cases, reporting defects clearly, and validating user flows that directly impact customer success.

I transitioned into tech after managing a high-volume barbershop for 7+ years — developing strong communication, leadership, and **attention to detail** that now strengthens my QA work.
